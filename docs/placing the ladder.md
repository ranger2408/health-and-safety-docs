!!!Quote " Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (SOR/86-304) 3.11(2) "

    Subject to subsection (3), every portable ladder shall, while being used,

    (a) be placed on a firm footing; and

    (b) be secured in such a manner that it cannot be dislodged accidentally from its position.

#### Surveying a backyard work area
It is essential that the employee takes stock of the area that they will be traversing through and setting the ladder up in. There are plenty of hazards to take note of and these are especially prevalent on a customers private property.

#### Unseen hazards
If it is needed to access the customers property for access to Cogeco's plant then the employee should take the time to discuss with the customer the intent to enter and enquire about hazards that might not be immediately apparent.

As the employee walks through the area to determine which path you might like to take to the pole or midspan take note of things that may obstruct you from safely carrying your ladder.
