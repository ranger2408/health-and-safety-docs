#### Health and safety committiees.

The purpose of the second part is for employers, employees and unions to work together to find a solution. Representatives and Committees are a way of keeping the issues in front to allow a resolution and discussion.<br><br>

A key objective of Part II of the Labor code is to establish a more efficient balance between what the regulator does and what the employers and employees have responsibility for in the workplace. <br>
*Responsibilities for workplace health and safety have been realigned by placing a greater onus on employers, employees and their unions to work together to ensure that workplace health and safety issues are identified and resolved in a timely manner.* <br>
One of the means of achieving this objective is to establish a committee structure that will ensure that health and safety issues are regularly on the agenda of senior management and employee representatives. This is achieved, first, through a corporate-level health and safety policy committee and, second, by enhancing the role, powers and level of involvement of workplace committees to allow them to better identify and resolve problems as they arise in the workplace.


#### Determining who represents the employees.

The number of employees the company employs will determine how the employees will be represented. <br>
IMS has 20 and up employees but not more than 300. <br>
IMS therefore has a Committee.<br>

NB. Up to 19 Health and Safety Representative
20 and up Workplace Health and Safety Committee
300 or more Policy Health and Safety Committee



#### The purpose of the committee.
The purpose of policy committees, or of the modified work place committee, is to address health and safety matters that apply to the work, undertaking or business of an employer.
