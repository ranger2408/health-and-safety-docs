!!!QUOTE "Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (SOR/86-304) 3.2"
    No employee shall use a temporary structure if it is feasible to use a permanent structure.

The nature of the work at IMS makes this impractical so make use of ladders which are temporary structures, to perform the work.


### Working weather conditions
!!! QUOTE "Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (SOR/86-304) 3.3"
    No employee shall work on a temporary structure in rain, snow, hail or an electrical or wind storm that is likely to be hazardous to the health or safety of the employee, except if the work is required to remove a hazard or to rescue an employee.

IMS employees are not to work in weather conditions that may be hazardous to the health or safety of the employee except in the case of removing a hazard or to rescue an employee.

### Employee training
!!!QUOTE "Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (SOR/86-304) 3.5"
    No employee shall use a temporary structure unless

    (a) he has authority from his employer to use it; and

    (b) he has been trained and instructed in its safe and proper use.

The employees must be both properly trained and approved by the employer for work on the ladder. Employees must not be on a ladder until this part is complete.
