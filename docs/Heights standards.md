The regulation refers to portable ladders which fall into the category of temporary structures.
These temporary structures are defined by the standard as a ladder that can be readily moved or carried and usually consists of side rails joined at intervals by steps, rungs, cleats or rear braces.

### Ladder groups
Ladders covered by the standard are organized into two groups which are determined by their structure and how they are supported while in use.

- Single ladders are supported by a structure like a building or pole and include: 

        - extension ladders 
        - combination ladders.


!!! NOTE "Extension Ladder as defined by the standard" 
    A non-self-supporting portable ladder consisting of two or more sections travelling in interlocking rails, guides, or brackets so arranged to permit length adjustment.
 

- Step Ladders are supported by an opposing ladder section and include:

        - trestle ladders; 
        - extension trestle ladders; 
        - platform ladders; 
        - step stools; 
        - combination ladders.


!!!NOTE "Step Ladder as defined by the standard"
    A self-supporting portable ladder, non-adjustable in length, having flat steps and hinged back. The back section consists of either a single ladder or other supporting device.

### Ladder grades
The standard further divides ladders into grades that determine their usage. IMS will use the lowest grade, grade 1 for heavy duty use.

    The weight ratings will include the weight of the employee and the weigght of the equipment and/or tools being carried.


### Scope of the standard
Ladders covered by this standard are intended for use by only one person at a time under normal conditions of usage, excepting only trestle ladders designed for use by two persons at the same time.

The requirements listed in this standard are intended to specify certain minimum characteristics of strength and stability deemed necessary for the safe use of portable ladders.

The standard covers single section ladders, multiple-section, and combination ladders but does not cover special-purpose ladders or ladder accessories such as ladder levellers, ladder stabilizers, or stand-off devices, ladder jacks, or ladder straps or hooks that may be installed on, or used in conjunction with ladders.
