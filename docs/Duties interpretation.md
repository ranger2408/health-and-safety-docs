### Work place defined.
A work place as defined in the interpretation section of part 2 of the act means any place where an employee is engaged in work for the employee’s employer.<br>
“Work place” should be given a very broad interpretation because the “work place” follows the employee wherever he or she may be while engaged in work for the employer. <br>
This includes locations where work is being performed outdoors and on third-party premises. <br>
The work place controlled by the employer is not necessarily a building, structure or surrounding property; it is any place owned or controlled by the employer where an employee is engaged in, or is likely to be engaged in, work for the employer. This would include the office, a customer's home or the work truck.<br>
Also, to be a workplace for the purposes of the Code, the place needs an employee who is, has been, or can be expected to be present in, passing through, or associated with that place.<br>

This last part can be interpreted as that while as long as that customer is subscribed to Cogeco they remain associated with the employer and therefore the property that contains the subscription service is a workplace. <br>
<br>
Section 126 (1)(c) states the responsibilities of the employee while in the workplace. <br>
It also states “any person likely to be affected by the employee’s act or omissions” <br>
The employee cannot leave anything unsafe after exiting the workplace, the employee must remove hazards found even if not put in place by the employee.<br>
The employee must also ensure they leave nothing unsafe and pick up all waste materials.<br>
They must also leave the workplace as found, for example making sure gates are closed to prevent dogs or children moving in ways the customer does not expect.<br>

!!!Quote "Canada Labor code part 2 Section 126 (1)"
    (c) take all reasonable and necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of the employee, the other employees and any person likely to be affected by the employee’s acts or omissions.


### Duty defined
Duties cover the "activities" of employees and other persons employed by a department or agency. Where the employer does not control the conditions in the workplace concerned, “activities”  include those occurring outside of work places under the employer’s control. <br>
Although employers may not be able to control a workplace, they can control the activities of their employees.<br>
This includes employees working in third-party premises, those who telework, and employees who have duties that are not conducted from a fixed location.<br>
This includes while commuting to and from work in a work vehicle and while at work.<br>
