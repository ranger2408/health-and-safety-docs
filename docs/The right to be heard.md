#### The internal complaint process.
Each employee is allowed to first bring a complaint to those who represent the employer to have it addressed in the proper manner.

Section 125 (1) (d)
make readily available to employees, in printed and electronic form,
(i) a copy of this Part and a copy of the regulations made under this Part that apply to the workplace,
(ii) a statement of the employer’s general policy concerning the health and safety at work of employees, and
(iii) any other information related to health and safety that is prescribed or that may be specified by the Head;


#### Bring the complaint th your supervisor.
The employee must take the step of bringing the issue or contravention of part 2 to the employer's attention via the supervisor who is the representative of the employer.

Section 126(1)(g)
Report to the employer any thing or circumstance in a workplace that is likely to be hazardous to the health or safety of the employee, or that of the other employees or other persons granted access to the workplace by the employer;

This complaint can be in written or oral form.

Section 127 (1.2)
The complaint may be made orally or in writing.

#### The role of the supervisor in the process. 
The employee should expect that the supervisor will:<br>
Treat the complaint as genuine and seek an immediate resolution.<br>
In no way retaliate, threaten or punish the employee for bringing the complaint to his attention.

#### Working to find a resolution.
The supervisor and employer shall work together to find a resolution that works for the employee. At this point the investigation will be recorded and tracked no matter the findings.
This will show that diligence is taken to resolve issues and allow the employer to have a record of the findings should the issue arise again.
