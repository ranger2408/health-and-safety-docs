### The canada labor code

The code is an act of parliament signed into law and must be followed the same as any law.<br>
This applies to <br>
<br>
1. *The law itself.*<br>
2. *The regulations that are written based on the law.*<br><br>

### Why must we follow canada labor code part 2?
Under section 2 subsection b of part 1 of this act we are federally regulated and must follow the canada labor code and regulations.

    federal work, undertaking or business means any work, undertaking or business that is within the legislative authority of Federal Parliament, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,

    (b) a railway, canal, telegraph or other work or undertaking connecting any province with any other province, or extending beyond the limits of a province,


### What is the purpose of part 2 of the labor code?
Explain the purpose of part 2: (part 2 section 122.1)
The purpose of Part II of the Code is to prevent accidents and injury to health arising:
out of
linked with 
Or occurring in the course of employment.

These laws are designed to prevent workplace related accidents and injuries including occupational disease.
This relates to occupational health and safety and reflects the desire to reduce workplace injury and accidents in federal jurisdiction. 

NB-
Although not a duty as such, this “purpose” clause is often used by boards and before the courts to interpret the Code or its regulations, and to decide whether an employer has fulfilled the responsibilities under the Code.

The intent should be applied to the extent possible, especially with respect to employer duties outlined in paragraphs 125(1)(z.03) and 125(1)(z.04) (prevention programs) and the associated regulations.

NB
When accepting an employment offer from a federally regulated company the employee is bound by the Canada Labor Code and all parts that pertain to the employee in it.

This same binding on the employee applies also to the health and safety regulations and employee employer policy since the health and safety regulations and employer policy are bound by the Canada Labor Code.

### company policy and the law.
Company policy while it is based on the code and the regulations is not law. <br>
An employee is given the right to refuse to follow company policy if he believes that the policy contravenes any part of the labor code part 2. <br>
<br>

### What does the law say about following company health and safety policy?
The employee is instructed to follow these instructions from the employer as detailed in section 126 (1)
!!! quote
    Section 126 (1) 
    (d) comply with all instructions from the employer concerning the health and safety of employees;

But this is not absolute, as the employee has the right to refuse work if he believes that part 2 is being contravened. More accurate is "follow the instructions given by the employer regarding health and safety as long as they comply with the second part of the labor code." <br>

If the employee believes part 2 is being contravened then that employee may now exercise his right to refuse work until the matter is resolved and brought into compliance with the law.

### What happens if the law is not followed?

The government specifies the consequences of not following the law in section 148 as the following<br>

- *A fine.* <br>
- *Imprisonment.* <br>
- *both a fine and imprisonment.*<br>

Not following the law as set out makes you liable to these if you are found to have contravened them willingly. <br>

!!! quote
    General offenses, but also applies to death or injury or risk of death or injury mentioned in subsections 2 or 3.<br>
    148 (1) Subject to this section, every person who contravenes a provision of this Part is guilty of an offense and liable.<br>
    (a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years, or to both; or
    (b) on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than $100,000. <br>


### What if the employer or employee acted in good faith?

The government does provide for this in section 148(4) with exceptions but the burden of proof is on the emplyer or employee to prove that they acted in good faith. <br><br>
!!! quote 
    (4) On a prosecution of a person for a contravention of any provision of this Part, except paragraphs 125(1)(c), (z.10) and (z.11), it is a defense for the person to prove that the person exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. However, no person is liable to imprisonment on conviction for an offense under any of paragraphs 125(1)(c), (z.10) and (z.11).
