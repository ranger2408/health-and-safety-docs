## The refusal to work process.
*Go over this one*
This is a provision enacted in 1978 that allows an employee to withdraw from work and initiate the formal investigation of a dangerous situation.

It is essential that managers and supervisors be aware of the broad scope and impact of the current definition of danger and the right to refuse dangerous work. In addition, labour relations officers who may be involved in refusal-to-work situations, and occupational health and safety staff who may be asked to provide advice on perceived situations of danger, must also be aware of the implications of its definition and the scope of the right to refuse dangerous work. Additional explanation of danger can be found in [Chapter 2](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/acts-regulations-policies-related-workplace-wellness-inclusion-diversity/manager-handbook-canada-labour-code-part-2.html#toc29).

### The definition of danger.
“Danger” means any existing or potential hazard or condition or any current or future activity that could reasonably be expected to cause injury or illness to a person exposed to it before the hazard or condition can be corrected, or the activity altered, whether or not the injury or illness occurs immediately after the exposure to the hazard, condition or activity, and includes any exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to result in a chronic illness, in disease or in damage to the reproductive system.

### The definition of safety.
“Safety” is defined as “protection from danger and hazards arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of employment.”

### The grounds for a refusal.
 if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that:

1.  the use or operation of the machine or thing constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee;
2.  a condition exists in the place that constitutes a danger to the employee; or
3.  the performance of the activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee.

They may initiate the investigation of a dangerous situation.

An employee cannot refuse to use or operate a machine or thing, refuse to work in a place, or refuse to perform an activity.
1. If the refusal puts the life, health or safety of another person directly in danger.
2. The danger is a normal condition of employment. 
3. 
### Reporting the danger.
An employee who refuses to work under the right-to-refuse provision or who is prevented from acting in accordance with the provision must report the circumstances of the matter to the employer without delay. 
The person to whom the report is made is likely to be the employee’s manager or supervisor. 
The manager or supervisor receiving the report should be fully aware of his or her responsibilities in investigating the circumstances of the refusal and of the rights of the employee making the report.

### The process.
If not resolved immediately this could involve members of the work place health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, or eventually a health and safety officer of HRSDC’s Labour Program.

Where a report is made under the above provision, the employee, if there is a collective agreement in place that provides for a redress mechanism in circumstances described in section 128, must inform the employer in a timely manner whether the employee intends to exercise recourse under the agreement or this section. The selection of recourse is irrevocable unless the employer and employee agree otherwise. This requirement is intended to resolve problems where collective agreements contain refusal-to-work provisions that can cause considerable delays if the choice of process is not declared early and “locked in” for the duration of the refusal.

##### The employers duty after a report.
If the employer agrees there is danger he shall take immediate action to protect the employees and notify the health and safety committee of the action to be taken. 
In this case the committee need not investigate and the committee will be informed of the actions.

##### Managers and supervisors.
Should make every effort possible to identify the reason for the reported refusal and resolve the concern by taking immediate action to protect the employee.

##### Continued refusal to work if the situation is not resolved.
Without delay, the employee must report the circumstances of the matter to the employer and to the work place committee (the committee) or the health and safety representative (the representative) (subsection 128(9)).

Immediately on being informed of an employee’s continued refusal, the employer (or a representative of) must investigate the matter in the presence of the employee who reported it and in the presence of (subsection 128(10)):

1.  at least one member of the work place committee who does not exercise managerial functions;
2.  the health and safety representative; or
3.  if no person is available under paragraph (_a_) or (_b_), at least one person from the work place who is selected by the employee.

If, and only if, an employee member of the committee or a representative is not readily available to participate in the investigation, the refusing employee can select another employee from that work place to be present to participate in the investigation.

If more than one employee has made a report of a similar nature, those employees may designate one employee from among themselves to be present at the investigation. This provision is intended to resolve situations where multiple refusals have a labour relations rather than a health and safety objective (subsection 128(11)).

Departments need to ensure that employees, managers and supervisors are aware of this provision, and that those employees involved are also aware of their right to designate one of them to represent their interests.

the employee does not need to be present for the investigation to proceed if the employee wishes to be absent.
The investigation of the danger can still proceed (subsection 128(12)) and should be documented in case a complaint is made to a health and safety officer.

##### The health and safety officer.
At this point the employer can, if the employee still does not agree with the actions taken, invoke the presence of a health and safety officer.
The employer must inform the committee or the representative of any steps taken by the employer under subsection 128(13). 

### Payment and alternative work.
Unless otherwise provided in a collective agreement or other agreement, employees are to be paid for the period of the work stoppage, or to the end of the shift, if they are unable to perform their work as the result of another employee’s refusal to work, or if alternative work is not available. With the collective agreements in place in the public service, this has not been an issue and is not expected to become one (subsection 128.1(1)).

##### The next shift.
Where there has been a stoppage of work arising from application of the right to refuse and if alternative work is not available, employees scheduled to work on the next shift must be given at least one hour’s notice not to attend work.

##### Alternate work.
An employer may assign reasonable alternative work to employees who are deemed to be at work under subsection (1) or (2) above. This provision provides managers or supervisors with the authority to assign alternative work to all or some employees affected by a work refusal (subsection 128.1(3)).

##### Unjustified refusal.
Employees affected by a work stoppage under a refusal to work may be required to repay wages and benefits paid during the period of “unjustified refusal” because another employee unjustifiably refused to work. After the employee has exhausted all avenues of redress, this provision applies unless a collective agreement or other agreement provides otherwise.


### The investigation by the Officer.
##### Those present in the investigation.
The investigation will take place in the presence of the employer of the employee and one other person who is an employee member of the work place committee, a representative or, in the absence of the above persons, another employee from the work place designated by the employee.
If the investigation involves more than one employee, those employees may in turn designate one employee from among themselves to be present at the investigation. However, a health and safety officer may proceed with an investigation in the absence of any person mentioned above if that person chooses not to be present or is unable to attend.
##### Prior to the investigation by an officer.
Before the health and safety officer’s investigation and decision, the employer may require that the employee concerned remain at a safe location near the place in respect of which the investigation is being made. The employer can also assign the employee reasonable alternative work (subsection 129(5)) but cannot assign any other employee to perform the refusing employee’s work unless:

1.  the other employee is qualified for the work;
2.  the other employee has been advised of the refusal of the employee concerned and of the reasons for the refusal; and
3.  the employer is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the other employee will not be put in danger.

### Notification of results by the officer.
A health and safety officer shall, on completion of an investigation made under this section, decide whether the danger exists and shall immediately give written notification of the decision to the employer and the employee. This is important in that the notification of the decision on the existence of danger shall be in writing and before the officer leaves the work place (subsection 129(4)).
If a health and safety officer decides that the danger exists, the officer shall issue the directions that the officer considers appropriate. An employee may continue to refuse to work until the directions are complied with or until they are varied or rescinded (subsection 129(6)).

##### If the employer disagrees with the decision.
The employer may appeal to an appeals officer authorised to determine if an appeal is warranted.
##### If an employee disagrees with the decision.
If a health and safety officer decides that there is no danger, the employee is not to continue to refuse to work. However, the employee, or a person designated by the employee, may appeal the decision in writing to an appeals officer within 10 days after receiving notice of the decision (subsection 129(7)).

##### The employee and the officers findings.
The refusing employee or employees may continue to refuse to perform the task in question or refuse to work in that location until the direction is complied with or amended by the appeals officer. These employees are entitled to refuse only the task in question; they are not entitled under the law to go home. The manager or supervisor should assign alternative work if at all possible.

Under certain circumstances, if the decision of danger clearly relates to the employee and the employee’s ability to do the job, the job may be assigned to another employee under the same conditions as specified in subsection 129(5).

##### If the officer is wrong about the danger.
In instances where a decision of no danger by a health and safety officer may be wrong and an employee may in fact still be at risk, an appeals officer most likely will give priority to these types of appeals over employer appeals of directions.

### Prohibited disciplinary action.
As for the internal complaint resolution process.

No employer shall dismiss, suspend, lay off or demote an employee, impose a financial or other penalty on an employee, or refuse to pay an employee remuneration in respect of any period of time that the employee would have worked, or take any disciplinary action against, or threaten to take any such action against, an employee because the employee:

1.  has testified or is about to testify in a proceeding taken or an inquiry held under this Part;
2.  has provided information to a person engaged in the performance of duties under this Part regarding the conditions of work affecting the health or safety of the employee or of any other employee of the employer; or
3.  has acted in accordance with this Part or has sought the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Part.

It is important for managers and supervisors to note that the complaint can be with respect to any prohibited action, especially that in paragraph (_c_) above, not just disciplinary or discriminatory action resulting from a disputed refusal to work.

### Complaints when there is action against employees.
This is a very significant and important provision in that a complaint may be made in writing to the Public Service Labour Relations Board (the Board) with respect to **any** disciplinary or prohibited discriminatory action (section 147), not merely those related to refusals to work.

In addition to being a prohibition enforceable through the courts, a complaint can be made to the Board by the employee, and the Board can hear the complaint under its own rules of procedure.

Furthermore, a person designated by the employee for that purpose could make the complaint on the employee’s behalf. Although an employee may contact a lawyer, the strong likelihood is that this other person will be an experienced union official or employee representative.

The impact could be significant if supervisors are not aware of the prohibition and the possible consequence of taking such action.
