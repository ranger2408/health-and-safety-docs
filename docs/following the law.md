The government specifies the consequences of not following the law in section 148 as the following<br>

- *A fine.* <br>
- *Imprisonment.* <br>
- *both a fine and imprisonment.*<br>

Not following the law as set out makes you liable to these if you are found to have contravened them willingly. <br>
