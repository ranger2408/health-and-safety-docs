### To and from the workplace

Ladders are transported from workplace to workplace with a ladder rack mounted on the trucks top. 
This should be inspected regularly and any issues reported to the employers supervisor.
The employee should make sure that the ladder is fully secured and locked in place when mounted on the ladder rack.
