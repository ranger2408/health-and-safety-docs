#### The right to know about hazards
Employees have the right to be informed of known or foreseeable hazards in the workplace and to be provided with the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary to protect their health and safety.

#### The right to know - methods of communication

Each employee has the right to know and the method of communication of that information shall be in a way that they can receive it.

(1) An employee with a special need shall be given any direction, notice, information, instruction or training that is required to be given to employees under this Part by any method of communication that readily permits the employee to receive it, including braille, large print, audio tape, computer disk, sign language and verbal communication.
Meaning of special need
(2) For the purposes of this section, an employee has a special need if the employee is affected by a condition that impairs their ability to receive any direction, notice, information, instruction or training given by a method that would otherwise be sufficient under this Part.

#### accessing information from the govt, employers and medical records.

Through their health and safety committees or representatives, employees are given the right to have access to government or employer reports relating to the health and safety of employees, but do not have access to medical records of any person except with that person's consent.

Section 136 (7) 
A health and safety representative, in respect of the work place for which the representative is appointed, shall have full access to all of the government and employer reports, studies and tests relating to the health and safety of employees, or to the parts of those reports, studies and tests that relate to the health and safety of employees, but shall not have access to the medical records of any person except with the personâ€™s consent.
